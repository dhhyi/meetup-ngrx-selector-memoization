## Abstract

Learning about NgRx is hard! Perfecting the usage of Effects and Selectors is even harder!

In this talk we are going to focus on one specific aspect of NgRx Selectors: Memoization.
When used properly, it can significantly boost up your application performance by preventing unnecessary view render updates.

We are going to cover fundamental principles, portrait common problems and of course discuss solutions.
